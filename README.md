For the purpose of this experiment it is only necessary to use the python jupyter notebook provided.
However, the convert_csv.py file demonstrates how the raw data is taken from .txt format into a .csv file which can be used in the notebook.

If the experiment is repeated then the following steps need to be follow:
- measure data with the application discussed
- copy the measured data into a .txt file
- change the folders "data_2_9", "data_9_9" to the required names
- run the convert_csv.py file
- edit the same folders names as presented in the notebook labelled "index_csv_1", "index_csv_2"
